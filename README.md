This code is a Python script that uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a given latitude and longitude coordinates represent an earthquake-prone location or not. It then visualizes the result on a world map using Cartopy.

Prerequisites
Before running this code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (3.x)
Pandas
Scikit-learn (for RandomForestClassifier)
Matplotlib
Cartopy
You will also need a dataset with earthquake records in CSV format. Ensure that the dataset includes columns for 'Latitude,' 'Longitude,' and a binary label, e.g., 'EarthquakeProne' (1 for earthquake-prone and 0 for non-prone).
